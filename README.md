# TaskList-Spring-Angular-Heroku
Task List Built on Spring and Angular running on Heroku

This is my demo application to test running a Spring Boot  / angular application on Heroku. 
You can test the application here. 
Note that it is only running on a free dyno, so it may take some time before it responds.

Running the application

#TODO 
#Complete the Instructions
#Add instructions for DB

To run the application from your IDE, 
  simply run the com.github.britter.springbootherokudemo.Application class as a Java Application. 
  Alternatively the application can be started from the terminal using maven with mvn spring-boot:run. 
  After starting the application, point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
